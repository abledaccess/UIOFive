FSSFive WordPress Theme Read Me...

Summary

FSSFive is a clean, simple and accessible WordPress blogging theme, employing components of The Fluid Project's <http://fluidproject.org/> Infusion framework, the Fluid Skinning System (FSS) and User Interface Options (uiOptions), just to name two. FSSFive is also HTML5-based. 

This is, or it is my hope that one day it will be, a solid a starting point. Granted much of what FSSFive uses to function as an accessible platform, mainly FSS and uiOptions, is still being developed. This will become ever more stable as time goes on. Both the work of the Fluid Project as well as my own, especially. I encourage users to build upon what is already here. And share what you have done. We're all in this together.

Not by any stretch of your imagination is it finished -- meaning there are more neat and exciting things yet to come. But, like most of everything on the web, it’s a work in progress.

FSSFive employs a lot of the standard WordPress elements, id's and classes. Tt also has the publishing requirements that adhere to the hNews Microformat.



FSSFive's Strength's

1. As stated above, HTML5 and hNews Microformat compatible.
2. FSSFive is aligned to the 12 column 960 grid system <http://960.gs>. 
3. Even though comments are functioning/looking properly and are threaded, it is recommended you only allow threaded comments to be threaded 5 levels deep. Any levels deeper comments begin appearing "cramped" (short horizontal reading lines). 
4. uiOptions <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/UI+Options+API> compatible. And coming soon.
5. Responsive. Scales from mobile to desktop browsing environments. And everything in between.
6. A full CSS3 and HTML5 custom build of Modernizr <http://modernizr.com> is running on FSSFive. Including response.js to handle (as in allowing) media queries to function in IE 8 and below. 
7. Plenty, but not all, regular id and class hooks throughout the theme to allow for predictable and additional WordPress customization.
8. SEO friendly page titles.
9. Still very much under development. Please direct any concerns, suggestions and issues you may be experiencing to FSSFive developer; http://abledaccess.com/contact/. Or here, my Github repo. Thanks.



FSSFive's Weakness' (which, as I said above, will continue to be addressed and improved)

1. No current page indication in the main navigation menu.
2. Backwards compatibility? While Infusion (FSSs parent framework) boasts support for legacy browsers, IE6 included, and, as of version 3.2, WordPress has dropped support for said browser, FSSFive makes no such guarantees support is provided. FSSFive was developed and has been testing both on recent releases of WordPress -- no earlier than 3.1 -- and with an array of modern browsers. Or in other words the CSS3 box-sizing property is used which will cause positioning inconsistencies in browsers that don't recognize CSS3. But more testing is currently pending.
